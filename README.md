# twitter-faves
An analysis on my preferences on twitter. This is a work in progress. Its final purpose will be to 
present it as a way to show how to use python and jupyter notebooks to people doing data science, but not yet familiar with the python toolkit, so the writing is rather casual since this is no academic paper. Herein I present `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, JupyterLab and some python along with it. I may make some slides that present the remaining ecosystem.

## Notebook index
The notebooks present a very simple pipeline in the following order:
1. [`collecting-data.ipynb`](./collecting-data.ipynb)
2. [`cleaning-data.ipynb`](./cleaning-data.ipynb)
3. [`clustering-tweets.ipynb`](./clustering-tweets.ipynb)


## Dependencies
- `conda` highly recommended
- `jupyter-lab`
- `nltk pandas scikit-learn`
- `wordcloud`
- `pip install python-twitter`
